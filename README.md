## 🎯 Features

- **Real-time Latency Monitoring** - Track server performance before, during, and after attacks
- **Proxy Support** - SOCKS5, SOCKS4, and HTTP proxy integration for anonymity
- **Multi-threaded Attacks** - Configurable bot threads for maximum impact
- **Live Progress Tracking** - Real-time statistics and latency visualization
- **Server Reconnaissance** - Pre-attack server information gathering
- **Impact Analysis** - Detailed effectiveness reporting with color-coded ratings

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements
```bash
pip install mcstatus pyfiglet pysocks
```

### Quick Start
```bash
python vortex.py
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Attack
1. Run the script
2. Enter target server IP and port (default: 19132)
3. Configure threads and duration
4. Monitor real-time impact

### Advanced Features
- **Proxy Integration**: Route attacks through SOCKS/HTTP proxies
- **Custom Delays**: Fine-tune packet timing for optimal impact
- **Live Metrics**: Watch latency spikes in real-time

## 🎮 Target Compatibility

- ✅ **Console Editions** (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch)

## 📊 Attack Metrics

The tool provides comprehensive performance analysis:

- **Baseline Latency** - Pre-attack server performance
- **Peak Latency** - Maximum latency achieved during attack
- **Latency Increase** - Percentage-based impact measurement
- **Effectiveness Rating** - Color-coded success assessment

## 🛡️ Proxy Configuration

### Supported Proxy Types
- **SOCKS5** (Recommended)
- **SOCKS4**
- **HTTP**

### Example Proxy Setup
```
Proxy Type: socks5
Proxy IP: 127.0.0.1
Proxy Port: 9050
```

## 📈 Effectiveness Ratings

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Protocol
Uses Minecraft Bedrock's native ping protocol for maximum compatibility

### Packet Structure
```python
PING_PACKET = b'\x01' + b'\x00' * 17
```

### Performance Optimization
- Multi-threaded design
- Non-blocking socket operations
- Efficient resource management

## 📋 Output Example

```
📡 Baseline Latency: 45.2 ms
💥 Peak Latency: 1250.8 ms
📉 Final Latency: 320.6 ms
🚀 Latency Increase: 2767.3%
🎯 Attack Effectiveness: 💀 DEVASTATING (100.0%)
```

## 🚨 Legal & Ethical Use

### Authorized Scenarios
- Testing your own servers
- Educational purposes
- Authorized penetration testing
- Security research

### Prohibited Use
- Attacking servers without permission
- Malicious disruption of services
- Harassment or griefing
- Any illegal activities

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Server appears offline** - Verify IP/port and server status
2. **Proxy connection failed** - Check proxy settings and connectivity
3. **Low effectiveness** - Increase threads or adjust delay timing

### Performance Tips
- Use higher thread counts for better impact
- Lower delays increase packet frequency
- Proxy usage may reduce attack speed
